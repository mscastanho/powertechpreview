Subject: [PATCH] Increase timeouts in test_subprocess

Under heavy load, the subprocess in test_wait_timeout may not complete
in 3s.  Increase that to 10s in order to reduce spurious failures.

Also, the thread in test_threadsafe_wait may need a bit more time to
guarantee it overlaps with the main thread and yield the expected
return code. Increase the timeout from 0.2 to 1 second.
